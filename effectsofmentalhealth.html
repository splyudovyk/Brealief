    <article>
        <p>Mental health is something that needs to be maintained. Without proper maintenaince, it will fall
            apart. And when your mental health falls apart, <strong>everything</strong> falls apart.</p>
        <p>What do I mean? I mean that one's physical health is completely tied to the fate of their mental wellbeing.
            There are many studies that show that those who suffer from mental disorders tend to be less healthy in
            general and in worse physical health. Depression is linked to many chronic illness, including cancer,
            diabetes, asthma, and arthritis. And overall, people with mental disorders tend to have shorter lifespans.
        </p>
        <p>Schizophrenia is associated with a tripled risk of dying from respiratory disease, as well as doubled risk of
            dying from heart disease. Depression correlates with a fifty percent increase in the possibility of dying
            from cancer and a sixty-seven percent increase in heart disease. While science doesn't know exactly how the
            brain is affecting physiological health, there are clear links between mental health and the health of the
            body.</p>
        <p>People with mental health problems tend to also suffer from sleep disorders. Diseases such as insomnia and
            sleep apnea cause a difficulty in sleeping. And sleep problems are famously bad for health, leading to a
            variety of different health conditions. This can range from a worse mood and memory to heart attacks and
            pimples.</p>
        <p>Some researchers hypothesize that the reason for the worse health problems of those afflicted by mental
            health is that they have a tendency to not visit healthcare centers and get themselves diagnosed. But this
            isn't fully confirmed, and most scientists really just have no idea why this is happening. They just know
            that poor mental health is bad for physical health.</p>
        <p>There tends to be a correlation between positivity and good health. Optimism, life satisfaction, and
            happiness are associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and body weight. And in conjunction, negativity
            leads to the opposite. Stress can lead to many chronic defects, and also, randomly, minor stomachaches.</p>
        <p>But mental health doesn't just affect your health. Oftentimes, when one's mental health deteriorates, it's
            infectious. Not literally, of course. But when someone's being a downer, it turns everyone into a downer.
            It's a phenomenon known as social contagion. You tend to slowly conform to the mindsets of those around you.
            And when those around you are mentally ill, well, it's not healthy for your own mindset.</p>
        <p>But for HTHS students, the most important effect of mental health is probably academic importance. And
            folks, let me tell you, depression makes your grades lower. Yes, yes. It's been confirmed by researchers and
            scientists. A bajillion studies. This is the most important effect of mental health.</p>
