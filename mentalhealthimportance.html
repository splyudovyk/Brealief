        <p>Robin Williams was nominated for four Academy Awards, received two Primetime Emmy Awards, six Golden Globe
            Awards, and five Grammy Awards. He hung himself with a belt.</p>
        <p>Vincent van Gogh was the greatest painter of his time, the "Christ of Coal Mines." He has created about 2,100
            artworks. He died shooting himself in the chest.</p>
        <p>Earnest Hemingway won the Pulitzer Prize and a Nobel Prize in Literature. Most of his works are considered
            American classics. He shot himself with a shotgun.</p>
        <p>So many valuable people have died in terrible ways. Please don't become one of them.</p>
        <p>Neglecting mental health has brought about so many tragedies. We need to start taking it more
            seriously.</p>
        <p>Currently, it's estimated that 20.6% of all US adults are affected by mental illness. Only about half are
            treated. This could be you.</p>
        <p>Therapy is incredibly beneficial. Stop stigmatizing it. Give it a try â€” it might change
            your life. And if other people are going to therapy, don't shame them for it. In fact, in this day and age,
            you'll probably be shamed for shaming them.</p>
        <p>Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death. Nearly 50,000 people die like this each year due to untreated
            mental illness. One in five people you know might have a mental illness. This number can easily be reduced
            by helping those who are suffering. Stop making fun of their treatment options. Normalize it.</p>
        <p>Change is happening. Mental health awareness is popping up all over the world. And there are hundred of
            groups dedicated to supporting the issue. This website has popped into existence. Times are different.
            Accept it.</p>
        <p>Mental health is important.</p>
